      "q1": "What is a tarot reading?",
      "a1": "A tarot reading is an ancient practice of self-knowledge where cards act as mirrors of your current situation, helping you reflect on your circumstances, emotions, and possible paths forward. It doesn't predict the future deterministically, but offers perspectives and guidance.",
      "q2": "How does AI interpretation work?",
      "a2": "Our AI has been trained with deep knowledge of traditional tarot symbolism. It analyzes the specific combination of cards that appear in your reading, their positions and orientations, to offer you a coherent and personalized interpretation that connects with your original question.",
      "q3": "Are my readings private?",
      "a3": "Absolutely. Your readings are completely private and only you can access them. We don't share your information with third parties and you can delete your history at any time. Your spiritual journey is yours alone."
